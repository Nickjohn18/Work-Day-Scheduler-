# Work-Day-Scheduler-

In this project, I was tasked to make a daily planer that keeps track of the time using moment.js. It's an 8 hour planner that starts from 9 AM - 5 PM. This planner is also color coded depending on the current time, whether time has passed, soon to come or what is present. I was also tasked to make sure that everything saved will also appear even after reloading the page using local storage.
